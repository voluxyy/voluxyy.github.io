          <p>In the second year at Ynov, we are required to do an internship to validate the year. I then proposed to do another internship with Bashroom, which they accepted. This second internship allowed me to be a bit more integrated and to work on tasks in collaboration with other interns.</p>

          <p>At the end of my second internship, I proposed to Bashroom to hire me on a part-time fixed-term contract with morning classes. This proposal was initially refused but allowed me to secure a contract a few months later.</p>
          <p>This contract is a privilege that allows me, at the time of writing this, to continue developing my skills and to work in collaboration with the entire Bashroom team.</p>
